# 🛒 Smart E-Commerce (React Native)

This project was built as part of a React Native learning course.  
The goal of the project is to practice essential mobile development concepts such as navigation, reusable components, state management with Redux Toolkit, custom UI building, and implementing a basic e-commerce flow.

It includes authentication screens, product listing, a functional cart, and global state logic—all implemented step by step as part of the learning process.
